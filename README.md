# ColoCrossing Hosting: Up to 35% Off VPS & Dedicated Servers, 10+ Global Data Centers

Picture this: You're shopping for hosting, clicking through endless provider websites, drowning in vague promises about "enterprise-grade" this and "cloud-optimized" that. Then you land on a provider that's been quietly doing the work since 2006, running actual data centers they own, not just reselling someone else's capacity.

That's ColoCrossing for you. They're not the flashiest name in hosting, but they've built something solid over nearly two decades. Headquartered in Buffalo, New York, they own and operate data centers across the United States, Canada, and Europe. We're talking locations in New York City, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Jose, Buffalo, Dublin, and Toronto.

What caught my attention wasn't just the geographic spread. It was the fact that they've survived in this cutthroat industry for 15+ years while others have vanished overnight. There's a customer review on Trustpilot from someone who's been with them since 2010 and literally can't remember their last unplanned outage. That's the kind of boring reliability you actually want from infrastructure.

**Current Promotions You Should Know About**

Right now, ColoCrossing is running some genuinely interesting deals. They've got code **CLOUD35OFF** knocking 35% off their monthly VPS and Cloud Metal server plans. That's not a tiny discount on an inflated price, it's a legitimate cut on already competitive rates.

For the annual folks, they're offering VPS plans starting at just $$10.99$$ per year. Not per month—per year. That's the kind of pricing that makes you do a double-take and check if there's a catch.

And if you're in the dedicated server market, they have Intel Xeon E3-1270v5 systems with 32GB RAM starting at $$35.00$$ monthly in Los Angeles. When you see hardware like that at those prices, it's worth paying attention.

**What They're Actually Offering**

Let me break down what you're looking at with ColoCrossing's main product lines, because the devil's in the details.

**VPS Hosting: The Entry Point**

Their Virtual Private Servers run on KVM virtualization with SSD storage. You get full root access, which means you're not stuck in some neutered environment where you can't actually configure things. They support both Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, AlmaLinux, Debian) and Windows Server editions.

Here's what the current pricing looks like with the **CLOUD35OFF** discount code:

| RAM | Storage | vCPU | Bandwidth | Network | Regular Price | Discounted Price | |
|-----|---------|------|-----------|---------|---------------|------------------|---|
| 1 GB | 25 GB SSD | 1 | 20 TB | 1 Gbps | $$3.95$$/mo | $$2.57$$/mo |  [Order VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 2 GB | 50 GB SSD | 2 | 20 TB | 1 Gbps | $$6.95$$/mo | $$4.51$$/mo |  [Order VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 4 GB | 100 GB SSD | 3 | 20 TB | 1 Gbps | $$13.95$$/mo | $$9.06$$/mo |  [Order VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 8 GB | 165 GB SSD | 4 | 20 TB | 1 Gbps | $$24.95$$/mo | $$16.21$$/mo |  [Order VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 12 GB | 200 GB SSD | 6 | 20 TB | 1 Gbps | $$39.00$$/mo | $$25.35$$/mo |  [Order VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 16 GB | 330 GB SSD | 8 | 20 TB | 1 Gbps | $$45.00$$/mo | $$29.25$$/mo |  [Order VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |

That 20TB bandwidth allocation across the board is generous. Most providers start throttling or charging overages way before you hit those numbers. And deployment is instant, not "we'll provision it in 24-48 hours" instant. Actually instant.

**Annual VPS Deals: For the Long-Termers**

If you're willing to commit for a year, the pricing gets even more interesting:

| RAM | Storage | vCPU | Bandwidth | Network | Annual Price | |
|-----|---------|------|-----------|---------|--------------|---|
| 1 GB | 30 GB SSD | 1 | 40 TB | 1 Gbps | $$10.99$$/year |  [Order Annual VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 2 GB | 40 GB SSD | 2 | 40 TB | 1 Gbps | $$15.99$$/year |  [Order Annual VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 4 GB | 60 GB SSD | 3 | 40 TB | 1 Gbps | $$20.99$$/year |  [Order Annual VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 8 GB | 80 GB SSD | 4 | 40 TB | 1 Gbps | $$39.99$$/year |  [Order Annual VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 12 GB | 100 GB SSD | 6 | 40 TB | 1 Gbps | $$59.99$$/year |  [Order Annual VPS](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |

Notice the bandwidth jumps to 40TB on annual plans. That's a nice touch. The smallest annual VPS works out to less than a dollar per month. Even accounting for the upfront payment, that's aggressive pricing.

**Dedicated Servers: The Real Hardware**

This is where things get interesting if you need serious compute. ColoCrossing offers everything from entry-level Xeon E3 systems to beast-mode dual AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon Platinum configurations. All servers come with 40TB bandwidth on 1Gbps ports, with the option to upgrade to 10Gbps ports on higher-tier systems.

Here's a selection of what they're offering:

| CPU | Cores/Threads | RAM | Storage | Bandwidth | Performance Score | Price | |
|-----|---------------|-----|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------|---|
| Intel Xeon E3-1240v3 | 4C/8T @ 3.4-3.8 GHz | 16 GB | 1 TB SSD | 40 TB @ 1 Gbps | 7,011 | $$34.95$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| Intel Xeon E3-1270v6 | 4C/8T @ 3.8-4.2 GHz | 32 GB | 1 TB SSD | 40 TB @ 1 Gbps | 8,866 | $$59.95$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| AMD Ryzen 9 3900X | 12C/24T @ 3.8-4.8 GHz | 128 GB DDR4 | 1 TB NVMe | 40 TB @ 1 Gbps | 32,556 | $$129.00$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 2x Intel Xeon E5-2660v2 | 20C/40T @ 2.2-3.0 GHz | 32 GB | 1 TB SSD | 40 TB @ 1 Gbps | 18,286 | $$139.95$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| AMD Ryzen 9 5950X | 16C/32T @ 3.4-4.9 GHz | 128 GB DDR4 | 1 TB NVMe | 40 TB @ 1 Gbps | 45,444 | $$159.00$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| AMD Ryzen 9 7950X | 16C/32T @ 4.5-5.7 GHz | 128 GB DDR5 | 2x 1.92 TB NVMe | 40 TB @ 10 Gbps | 62,511 | $$179.00$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 2x Intel Xeon E5-2683v4 | 32C/64T @ 2.1-3.0 GHz | 256 GB DDR4 | 1 TB SSD | 40 TB @ 10 Gbps | 28,156 | $$189.95$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 2x Intel Xeon E5-2699v4 | 44C/88T @ 2.2-3.6 GHz | 128 GB DDR4 | 1 TB SSD | 40 TB @ 10 Gbps | 43,372 | $$229.95$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 2x AMD EPYC 7551 | 64C/112T @ 2.0-3.0 GHz | 128 GB DDR4 | 2x 1.92 TB NVMe | 40 TB @ 10 Gbps | 57,841 | $$249.00$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| AMD Ryzen 9 9950X | 16C/32T @ 4.3-5.7 GHz | 192 GB DDR5 | 1x 1.92 TB NVMe | 40 TB @ 10 Gbps | 66,100 | $$289.00$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| AMD EPYC Milan 7C13 | 64C/128T @ 2.0-3.7 GHz | 256 GB DDR4 | 2x 1.92 TB NVMe | 40 TB @ 10 Gbps | 76,367 | $$449.00$$/mo |  [Order Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |

Those PassMark performance scores give you a reality check on what you're actually getting. A dual EPYC 7551 system at $$249$$ monthly with 128GB RAM and dual NVMe drives is legitimately competitive. When you start pricing comparable configurations elsewhere, you'll see what I mean.

The newer AMD Ryzen systems are particularly interesting. That 7950X with DDR5 memory at $$179$$ monthly is a sweet spot for workloads that benefit from single-thread performance and modern memory architecture.

**Los Angeles Special Server Deals**

They're running location-specific deals in Los Angeles with Intel Xeon E3-1270v5 systems. These are available while inventory lasts:

| CPU | RAM | Storage | Bandwidth | Price | |
|-----|-----|---------|-----------|-------|---|
| Intel Xeon E3-1270v5 | 32GB DDR4 | 1TB HDD | 40TB @ 1Gbps | $$35.00$$/mo |  [Order LA Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| Intel Xeon E3-1270v5 | 32GB DDR4 | 1TB SSD | 40TB @ 1Gbps | $$39.00$$/mo |  [Order LA Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| Intel Xeon E3-1270v5 | 32GB DDR4 | 2TB SSD | 40TB @ 1Gbps | $$49.00$$/mo |  [Order LA Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| Intel Xeon E3-1270v5 | 32GB DDR4 | 1TB HDD | Unmetered @ 1Gbps | $$95.00$$/mo |  [Order LA Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| Intel Xeon E3-1270v5 | 32GB DDR4 | 1TB SSD | Unmetered @ 1Gbps | $$99.00$$/mo |  [Order LA Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| Intel Xeon E3-1270v5 | 32GB DDR4 | 2TB SSD | Unmetered @ 1Gbps | $$109.00$$/mo |  [Order LA Server](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |

The unmetered bandwidth options are worth noting if you're running content delivery or high-traffic applications. Going from 40TB to truly unmetered for an extra $$60$$ monthly is reasonable pricing.

**Cloud Metal Servers: The Hybrid Approach**

These are interesting because they bridge the gap between VPS flexibility and dedicated server performance. You get dedicated CPU cores, not shared vCPU time slices, but with cloud-style instant deployment. The **CLOUD35OFF** code applies here too:

| RAM | Storage | Dedicated CPUs | Bandwidth | Regular Price | Discounted Price | |
|-----|---------|----------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---|
| 8 GB | 120 GB SSD | 4 | 20 TB @ 1 Gbps | $$20.00$$/mo | $$13.00$$/mo |  [Order Cloud Metal](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 16 GB | 250 GB SSD | 8 | 20 TB @ 1 Gbps | $$38.00$$/mo | $$24.70$$/mo |  [Order Cloud Metal](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |
| 32 GB | 500 GB SSD | 8 | 20 TB @ 1 Gbps | $$78.00$$/mo | $$50.70$$/mo |  [Order Cloud Metal](https://cloud.colocrossing.com/aff.php?aff=556) |

If you've got licensing requirements that need dedicated cores, or workloads sensitive to the "noisy neighbor" problem with traditional VPS, this is where you'd look.

**What People Are Actually Saying**

I went through reviews across multiple platforms, and there's a pattern. The long-term customers love them. There's literally a person who's been with them for 15 years and wrote they "can't remember the last unplanned outage." Another customer running multiple companies has been there for 12 years.

The support gets consistent praise. Multiple reviews mention ticket responses in 5-10 minutes, sometimes 30 seconds. One customer said, "I've seen my tickets responded to within 30 seconds of opening them and I have yet to see this anywhere else." That's the kind of support that matters when your infrastructure is down at 2 AM.

The complaints, when they exist, tend to fall into a few categories. Some people report that ColoCrossing's IP ranges occasionally end up on spam blacklists because other customers run email servers badly. That's the nature of shared IP space. They do offer solutions if you need clean IPs for email delivery, but it requires opening a support ticket.

There are also a handful of reviews mentioning issues with spam from other customers on the network. This seems to be more about ColoCrossing's reputation as a budget-friendly provider that attracts all kinds of customers, not all of them running legitimate operations.

The mixed reviews on sites like WHTop show a $$2.8/10$$ rating, which sounds terrible until you read the actual complaints. Many are from years ago, and the recent feedback from active customers tells a different story. Trustpilot shows more balanced recent reviews, with long-term customers consistently rating them highly.

**The Infrastructure Story**

ColoCrossing didn't start as a cloud reseller. They built actual data centers, starting with Buffalo in 2006. In March 2009, they expanded to Chicago's Dupont Fabros facility. By June 2015, they opened their third Buffalo location, bringing them to 11 total facilities.

In January 2025, they just launched a new Los Angeles facility, continuing their expansion strategy. These are Tier-III data centers with SSAE 16 certification where applicable. They own the infrastructure, which means when something breaks, they're not waiting on another company to fix it.

Their network setup includes 100% uptime SLA backing. That's not just marketing speak when you have customers who've genuinely experienced years without unplanned downtime. They offer BGP sessions if you have your own IP space and need advanced routing control.

Security includes biometric access, 24/7 video surveillance, and manned security. They maintain ISO 27001, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance for customers who need those certifications.

**Things They Don't Make Obvious But Should**

Port 25 is blocked by default to prevent spam abuse. If you need to run mail servers, you'll need to open a ticket and explain your use case. They'll enable it for legitimate business needs, but this isn't automatic.

DDoS protection is included up to 2Gbps. For larger attacks, they offer enhanced protection up to 40Gbps for an additional fee. If you're running anything that might attract attention from script kiddies, this matters.

They don't offer free trials, but they do provide Looking Glass tools to test network performance before you commit. It's at lg.buf.colocrossing.com if you want to check latency and routing from their infrastructure.

IPv6 is supported on dedicated servers but availability depends on the specific network segment. It's worth confirming when you order if you specifically need IPv6.

**Who This Actually Makes Sense For**

If you're running development environments that don't need enterprise support contracts, the budget VPS plans are solid. That $$10.99$$ annual option is perfect for testing, staging servers, or personal projects.

For agencies managing multiple client sites, the mid-tier VPS and Cloud Metal options offer good price-to-performance. The ability to scale resources without migrating servers is useful when client demands change.

The dedicated servers shine for anyone running databases, game servers, or applications that need consistent performance. Those dual EPYC systems with 10Gbps ports can handle serious workloads without breaking the budget.

Colocation customers seem particularly happy. If you own hardware and want professional facility infrastructure without building your own data center, they offer everything from single server colocation to full cabinets and private cages.

**The Bottom Line**

ColoCrossing isn't trying to be the premium hosting provider with white-glove service and enterprise pricing. They're the practical choice, the one that's been quietly operating data centers while flashier competitors burned through VC money and disappeared.

Their strength is straightforward: they own infrastructure, they've been doing this for nearly 20 years, and their long-term customers stick around because things work. The pricing is competitive without feeling like there's a catch. The support is responsive. The network has proven reliability over time.

The 35% discount with code **CLOUD35OFF** brings already reasonable prices into genuinely attractive territory. Whether you need a simple VPS for $$2.57$$ monthly or a dual EPYC beast with 10Gbps connectivity, the options are there.

If you're tired of hosting providers that overpromise and underdeliver, ColoCrossing might be exactly the boring reliability you're looking for. Sometimes boring is exactly what you want from infrastructure.
